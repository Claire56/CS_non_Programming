1. Difference between dynamic type and static type languages 
First, dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.

Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not. Consider the two following code examples:
